Basic Structure:
lst[start:stop] # items start through stop-1
lst[start:] # items start through the rest of the array
lst[:stop] # items from the beginning through stop-1
lst[:] # a copy of the whole array
lst[1:] vs. lst[1:-1]?
lst[1:] will give you the slice from the second item till the end;
lst[1:-1] will return the slice from the second item till the second last item.
